# life_expectancy_viz

A small visualization inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11cqnxe/oc_life_expectancy_across_the_world_by_gender/) r/dataisbeautiful community post.

I found this plot made in MATLAB very interensting and at first I was wondering if I can do that in python. Then I thought maybe I can enrich that with additional data on factors that affect longlivity, like drugs&alco, healthcare availability, suicide rates -- all that bby gender. And somewhere on the way passing GDP and stuff and contemplating on how to properly apply Gini index i caught myself that what i am doing is literelly reinventing bycicle: all that data and viz already exist in World Bank and UN and so on. So I decided to stop here, at the initial plot.

I found this plot created in MATLAB very interesting, and at first, I was intrigued if I could replicate it in Python. Which i did. Then I thought about enriching it with additional data on factors that may affect longevity, such as drug and alcohol use, healthcare availability and suicide rates â€”- all that broken down by gender. And somewhere along the way, while considering GDP and other factors, and pondering how to properly apply the Gini index, I realized I was essentially reinventing the wheel. All this data and visualization already exist in organizations like the World Bank and the UN (my main sources of data here). So, I decided to stop at the initial plot.

Here' s the result
